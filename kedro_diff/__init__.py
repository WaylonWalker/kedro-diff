"""Kedro Diff - quickly diff kedro history

kedro diff aims to be a familiar interface into comparing two points in
history. Git diffs are fantastic tools but often are too granular to see what
has changed inside the pipeline. kedro diff aims to be a familiar tool at a
higher level so we can see changes to nodes (names, inputs, outputs, tags).
